                    <p>The dataset was pretty clean to begin with. Each of the twelve data files, had 
                        lines with no content as well as duplicate lines.</p>
                    <p>The address column contained the customer's full address. I would like to be 
                        able to count number of cites and states in the dataset, so I broke that column

                    <p>It is clear that the dataset is probably a sample of a bigger dataset, since 
                        it is limited to only eight states. However, analyzing the data, we can see 
                        that, California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts make up 80% of the total 
                        sales.</p>
                    <p>The fact that it is half of the states that make up the 80% is a sign of a

                    <p><b>Suggest Complimentary Items: </b>When selling phones, show the 
                        customer phones accessories like charging cables and headphones. 
                        When showing laptops, additions like headphones and monitors should 
                        be suggested as add-ons. If the complimentary products were not
                        purchased at the time, there should be a follow up to suggest purchase.</p>     
                    <p><b>Batteries: </b>At check-out, customers should 
                        be offered to add a pack of batteries. Many times, people like
                        to have spare batteries but it is not something people will actually
                        go shopping for on its own.</p>
                    <p><b>Go the Extra Mile For the First Time Purchase Customer: </b>Multiple customers 
                        are repeat customers. In making the first
                        purchase easy and uneventful, the customer is likely to return for additional
                        purchases that may or may not be related to the first purchases. Getting the first 
                        purchase from a customer is the purchase we spend the most marketing dollar
                        to get, after that, the customer will sell themselves the idea to buy since they 
                        are familiar with the purchasing experience, and have enjoyed it in the past.</p>
                    <p><b>Apple's Products: </b>While Apple's products outsell the counterparts and 
                        the customers seem to not mind the higher price, it is important to keep inventory
                        that can ship right away.</p>
