## As a Member of Your Engineering Team, I Can ...

**Build tools or create processes to collect data** from for example business transactions, digital forms, proprietary or public APIs, databases and datasets, to ensure uniform data.

**Clean and structure data.** By identifying, removing or replacing outliers, duplicates and null values. Enriching data with calculated fields, splitting into smaller bites or encoding categories numerically.

**Develop machine learning data models.** It is not always possible to see trends and possibilities with graphics and statistic. Machine learning can see groupings in the data or suggest possible future outcomes based on past numbers.

**Find opportunities and discover threats.** Depending on the question, a descriptive analysis tells us what happened, a diagnostic analysis tells us why it happened, a predictive analysis projections about the future, and prescriptive analysis tell us how and what to action.

**Visualize data findings** in easy to understand presentations or accessible dashboards.
