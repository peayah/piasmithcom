          <p class="card_text"><b>Career Coach and Consultant - Pathways Career Consulting</b> </p>
          <p class="card_text">I asked Pia to design my website for me. I think she was really thoughtful in how she listened to my, admittedly vague, goals. She listened for the ideas in between all the scattered information I gave her and created something that reflected my style and vision for my business. I appreciate her ability to take words and feelings and turn them into images. I particularly like Pia&#39;s ability to design logos. She designed a logo for another completely different project and demonstrated her skills in a completely different genre.</p>

          <p class="card_text"><b>Business Development Consultant - Social CRM World</b> </p>
          <p class="card_text">I needed an urgent help with designing marketing materials and Pia was the one who immediately responded; she learned very quick the purpose of the project and was able to create all the designs for me: poster, postcards and the layout for my PowerPoint presentation. She delivered everything on time and everything has been done with great quality. I would definitely recommend Pia!</p>

          <p class="card_text"><b>Communications Assistant - Moreau Catholic High School</b> </p>
          <p class="card_text">Pia is a terrific graphic designer with outstanding project management skills. She can easily juggle multiple projects; deliver them on time and on budget. She establishes relationships with her clients. While working with her, there were many times an internal client needed an emergency project completed the same day. With her considerable computer skills, she is able to complete projects with a fast turnaround and keep the client happy. Pia has a calm, positive personality and keeps her eyes on client satisfaction.</p>

          <p class="card_text"><b>Director Of User Experience - Getting to Know Cancer</b> </p>
          <p class="card_text">I had the chance to work with Pia during the design and implementation of the Getting to know Cancer (Non Profit) Site. Though Pia came on a little late into the project, she quickly came up to speed with how the site was structured and the design process. She was also instrumental in providing several excellent solutions on how to templatize the site to ensure the site could be scaled in the future. She also showed excellent proactiveness in researching methods to enhance the overall implementation of the site. I would strongly recommend her for any web design projects especially when the requirements are in a constant state of flux as she has clearly shown that she is very adaptable to whatever the situation requires</p>

          <p class="card_text">Pia&#39;s a dedicated web designer who really listens to what her clients want and need, and asks the right questions to elicit answers when they aren&#39;t sure themselves. She presented a number of great options for my website redesign, and came up with something fun and creative. She&#39;s also been quick to respond when I&#39;ve needed small tweaks made. I&#39;d definitely recommend her!</p>
